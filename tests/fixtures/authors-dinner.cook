Brown @beef{500%g} on all sides in a large heavy pot, then remove and set aside.

In the same pot, cook diced @onion{2} and @garlic{4%cloves} until softened and golden.

Stir in @tomato-paste{1%tbsp} and cook for 1 minute, then dust with @flour{1%tbsp} and stir well to combine.

Deglaze the pot with @red-wine{1%cup}, stirring to loosen any browned bits.

Return the @beef to the pot and add @beef-stock{2%cup}, along with @thyme{1%sprig} and @rosemary{1%sprig}.

Add @carrot{3} cut into chunks, cover the pot, and simmer over low heat for 2-3 hours until the @beef is very tender.

Check occasionally and add more broth if needed to keep the meat partially submerged.

Serve the tender @beef in its rich gravy with crusty bread for soaking up the sauce.
