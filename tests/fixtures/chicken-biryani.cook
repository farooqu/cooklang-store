---

Marinate @chicken{1%kg} in @yogurt{1%cup} and @ginger-garlic-paste{2%tbsp} for at least 1 hour.

Heat @ghee{4%tbsp} in a heavy-bottomed pot and fry @onion{3} until deep golden brown.

Cook @basmati-rice{2%cup} in boiling salted water until 70% done, then drain well.

Layer the marinated @chicken and the partially cooked @basmati-rice in the pot, interspersing layers with @coriander{1%bunch} and @mint{1%bunch}.

Seal the pot with foil and a tight-fitting lid, then heat on high for about 5 minutes until you hear steam building up.

Reduce heat to low and cook for 45 minutes without opening the lid, allowing the chicken and rice to cook through their own steam.
