Preheat oven to 325°F.

Mix @graham-cracker-crumbs{2%cup} with @butter{4%tbsp} and press firmly into the bottom of a springform pan to form the crust.

Beat @cream-cheese{500%g} and @sugar{300%g} together with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes.

Add @egg{4} one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until incorporated.

Fold in @sour-cream{1%cup}, @vanilla{1%tsp}, and @lemon-juice{1%tbsp} until just combined.

Pour the filling over the crust and bake for 50-60 minutes until the center is just set but still slightly jiggly.

Turn off the oven and crack the door open about 2 inches, letting the cheesecake cool slowly in the oven for 1 hour to prevent cracking.

Remove from oven and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving.
