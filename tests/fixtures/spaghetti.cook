Deglaze the pan with @red-wine{1%cup} and let it simmer for 2 minutes.

Add @tomato-sauce{800%ml}, @basil{1%bunch}, and @oregano{1%tsp}, then season with @salt{to taste} and @black-pepper{to taste}.

Simmer the sauce for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow flavors to develop.

Cook @spaghetti{400%g} in salted boiling water until al dente, then drain.
