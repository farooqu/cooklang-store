Whisk @egg-yolk{6} with @sugar{150%g} over a double boiler until the mixture becomes thick, pale, and reaches 160°F for food safety.

Remove from heat and fold in @mascarpone{500%g} gently until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

Combine @coffee{1%cup} and @coffee-liqueur{2%tbsp} in a shallow bowl for dipping.

Dip each @ladyfinger{24} briefly in the coffee mixture and arrange them in a single layer in your serving dish.

Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the @ladyfinger layer.

Add another layer of coffee-dipped @ladyfinger and top with the remaining mascarpone mixture.

Dust generously with @cocoa-powder{} and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.
