Preheat oven to 350°F.

Heat @milk{1%l} with @vanilla-bean{1} split and scraped until steaming, then remove from heat and let steep for 15 minutes.

Whisk @egg{5} and @egg-yolk{2} with @sugar{100%g} until the mixture is pale and thick.

Remove the @vanilla-bean from the milk and slowly pour the hot @milk into the egg mixture while whisking constantly to temper the eggs.

Strain the custard mixture through a fine sieve to remove any lumps and ensure a smooth texture.

Pour @caramel{100%ml} into a flan dish, tilting to coat the bottom evenly.

Pour the strained custard over the @caramel and place the flan dish in a larger water bath that comes halfway up the sides of the dish.

Bake for about 50 minutes until the custard is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the very center.

Cool the flan completely in the water bath, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

Run a sharp knife around the edges of the flan and invert onto a serving plate so the caramel sauce runs over the top.
